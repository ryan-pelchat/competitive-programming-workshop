Language: Python3

Approach:
    - strategy
        - Iterative Search
        - Used bitmask as a set
        - To be Jolly, absolute differences of successive elements must
          be exactly the set {1..nâˆ’1}
            - We can get 3 things out of this
                1. if there are duplicate numbers, then Not Jolly
                2. if numbers are outside of range, then Not Jolly
                3. if ~1 ^ ~2 => Jolly (if not 1 and 2 then Jolly)
    - technique (two pointers, recursion, BFS, etc...)
        - Complete Search with pruning
    - why did you choose it?
    - edge cases considered?
        - difference is 0

Time Complexity: 0(n)
Space Complexity: 0(1)
    - The input is a given
    - Other variables are scalar

Notes:
3.2.3 Complete Search Tips #5
For Python users, read all input first upfront before processing them
in-memory and buffer output first before writing them out in one go...
